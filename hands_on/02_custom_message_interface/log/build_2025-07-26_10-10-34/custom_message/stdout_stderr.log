[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_message.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_message", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_message"
  with any of the following names:

    custom_messageConfig.cmake
    custom_message-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_message" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "custom_message_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "custom_message" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
