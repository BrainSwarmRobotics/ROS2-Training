# ðŸ§± ROS 2 Boilerplates

This directory contains reusable **ROS 2 boilerplate code** to help you kickstart development faster. Whether you're building nodes, setting up custom message interfaces, or configuring robot control, these templates are designed to get you up and running quickly with best practices in mind.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

Each folder in this directory offers a minimal, ready-to-use template built around a specific ROS 2 concept or configuration. Easily plug in your custom components to adapt and extend these boilerplates for your unique application needs.

Whether you're launching a robot model, building a simulation world, or interfacing with real hardware, these templates accelerate development and ensure clean separation of concerns.

ðŸ“¦ Each boilerplate is self-contained and designed for **easy customization**. Simply drop in your own meshes, URDF files, or controller logic where specifiedâ€”no need to reconfigure from scratch.

Included boilerplates:

- **Spawn URDF in Simulation** â€“ Quickly deploy robot models into Ignition Gazebo or RViz.
- **Create Custom Simulation Environments** â€“ Set up entire worlds by just placing your mesh files.
- **Hardware Interface Boilerplate** â€“ A minimal setup for integrating custom hardware with `ros2_control`.
