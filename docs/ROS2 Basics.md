## Introduction to ROS2

- ROS2 is a communication middleware designed for distributed robotic systems.
- It uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) under the hood to ensure flexible, real-time, and scalable communication.

------

## ROS2 Nodes

- A **Node** is the fundamental executable in ROS2.
- Each node performs a single responsibility like reading sensor data, running algorithms, or controlling motors.

### Example:

- A `lidar_node` for reading laser scan data.
- A `navigation_node` for planning paths.

------

## Publisher and Subscriber

In ROS 2, **publishers** and **subscribers** are the foundation of **topic-based communication** ‚Äî a core part of the ROS architecture.

- A **publisher** sends out data on a specific topic.
- A **subscriber** listens to that topic and receives data when it's published.

This communication is **asynchronous**, meaning publishers and subscribers are decoupled and don‚Äôt need to know about each other.

------

### üîÅ How it Works

1. The **publisher** advertises a topic with a specific message type.
2. The **subscriber** subscribes to that topic and waits for messages.
3. When the publisher sends a message, all subscribers to that topic receive it.

------

### üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example

Let‚Äôs say we have a robot with a camera:

- **Publisher**: A camera node publishes images to `/camera/image_raw` (message type: `sensor_msgs/msg/Image`).
- **Subscriber**: An image processing node subscribes to `/camera/image_raw` to detect objects.

## Topics and Messages

- **Topics** are asynchronous communication channels used for one-to-many or many-to-one communication.
- **Messages** are the data packets exchanged on topics.

### Common Topics:

- `/cmd_vel` ‚Äî commands for robot velocity.
- `/odom` ‚Äî robot odometry information.
- `/scan` ‚Äî LiDAR scan data.

### Example:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.0}, angular: {z: 0.5}}"
```

### üì¶ ROS 2 Messages and Message Types

ROS 2 uses strongly typed messages for communication between nodes. Each message is defined using a `.msg` file with predefined field types, which are language-agnostic but map directly to types in Python and C++.

| **ROS 2 Message Type**                | **Example**            | **Python 3 Equivalent**                 | **C++ Equivalent**          | **Usage**                                                    |

| `bool`                                | `bool is_active`       | `bool`                                  | `bool`                      | For binary flags or toggle states                            |
| `char`, `byte`                        | `char key`, `byte val` | `str` (length 1), `int`                 | `char`, `uint8_t`           | For individual characters or raw bytes                       |
| `time`, `duration`                    | `time stamp`           | `builtin_interfaces.msg.Time`           | `rclcpp::Time`              | Timestamps for synchronization, delay calculations           |
| `geometry_msgs/msg/Point`             | `Point position`       | `x, y, z` floats in object              | `geometry_msgs::msg::Point` | 3D positions in space                                        |
| `std_msgs/msg/Header`                 | `Header header`        | object with `stamp`, `frame_id`         | Same in C++                 | Timestamp and reference frame info for time-sensitive data   |

### üìò Notes:

- ROS messages are defined in `.msg` files and compiled into Python and C++ classes.
- Each message type supports **serialization** and **transport** across ROS middleware (DDS).
- Use [ros2 interface show `<package>/msg/<Message>`] to explore message structure.

## Services

- **Services** provide synchronous communication ‚Äî a request is sent and a response is received.
- Ideal for operations that are infrequent and require feedback.

### Use Case:

- Starting or stopping a camera feed.
- Sending a target position for a manipulator.

### Example:

```bash
ros2 service call /start_motor std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"
```

------

## Actions

- **Actions** allow long-running, goal-oriented operations that can be cancelled or monitored.
- Ideal for operations like navigation, manipulation, or trajectory execution.

### Use Case:

- Sending a goal location to a mobile robot.
- Grasping an object with a robotic arm.

### Example:

```bash
ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose "{pose: { ... }}"
```
